# TypeScript_training
This is my TypeScript training repo. I am using tutorials from https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6vRUjYqDuoUsYsku86Lrsw  And documentation from https://www.typescriptlang.org/ 
After installing in VSC with npm, TS is compiling, showing problems as I type, and I got few basic usage examples.
