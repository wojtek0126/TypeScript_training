# TypeScript_training
This is my TypeScript training repo. I am using tutorials from https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6vRUjYqDuoUsYsku86Lrsw  And documentation from https://www.typescriptlang.org/ 
So far I got through part one. Difference was that I use npm, and there was yarn. No problem. TS is compiling as I type and I got few basic usage examples.
